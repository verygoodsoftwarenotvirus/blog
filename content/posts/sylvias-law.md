## Sylvia Joyce

My aunt Sylvia was my grandmother's first child. My grandmother married my grandfather against her guardians' wishes, and my grandfather was in the military, so she was entirely alone when Sylvia came. They had a deep bond founded in their mutual, but not equal, helplessness.

My aunt Sylvia would live a full life, ups, downs, and everything in between. She got married, divorced, had children, found love again, vacationed, sang, sewed, and more than anything, loved her family. In 2018, she was diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer.

She spent her last days in a hospice care facility in San Antonio. We visited her and she remarked how the hospice care facility didn't have good food, and all she wanted was some decent italian. It's San Antonio, I'll remind you, so they don't have any, but I looked up the best-rated local italian place and had them deliver a whole lasagna and slice of chocolate cake to her room. I think it might have been the only kindness I ever did to her.

At Aunt Sylvia's funeral, we were making casual conversation when her daughter mentioned the nightmare she had just had to deal with when closing out her mom's affairs. Aunt Sylvia had been renting an apartment on her meager Social Security when she found out she had cancer. She basically immediately went into the throes of chemotherapy and treatment, and consequently, was too busy dying to pay her last month's rent. When my cousin went to fetch family heirlooms from her mom's last dwelling, the landlord stood between her and the doorway and demanded the last month's rent, $800, before letting my cousin in. As we were driving home, I told my wife "that shit should be fucking illegal." So we made it so.

### Legislating

My wife, at the time, was Chief of Staff for the state representative who presided over the district containing the hospice center and apartment complex. I don't think I could have said "that shit should be fucking illegal" to a person more capable of making it so.
