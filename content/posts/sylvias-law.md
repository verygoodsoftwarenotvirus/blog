## The Life of Sylvia Joyce

My aunt Sylvia was my grandmother's first child. My grandmother married my grandfather against her guardians' wishes, and my grandfather was in the military, so she was entirely alone when Sylvia came. They had a deep bond founded in their mutual, but not equal, helplessness.

My aunt Sylvia would live a full life, ups, downs, and everything in between. She got married, divorced, had children, found love again, vacationed, sang, sewed, and more than anything, loved her family. In 2018, she was diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer.

## The Death of Sylvia Joyce

She spent her last days in a hospice care facility in San Antonio. We visited her and she remarked how the hospice care facility didn't have good food, and all she wanted was some decent italian. It's San Antonio, I'll remind you, so they don't have any, but I looked up the best-rated local italian place and had them deliver a whole lasagna and slice of chocolate cake to her room. I think it might have been the only kindness I ever did to her.

At Aunt Sylvia's funeral, we were making casual conversation when her daughter mentioned the nightmare she had just had to deal with when closing out her mom's affairs. Aunt Sylvia had been renting an apartment on her meager Social Security when she found out she had cancer. She basically immediately went into the throes of chemotherapy and treatment, and consequently, was too busy dying to pay her last month's rent. When my cousin went to fetch family heirlooms from her mom's last dwelling, the landlord stood between her and the doorway and demanded the last month's rent, $800, before letting my cousin in. As we were driving home, I told my wife "that shit should be fucking illegal." So we made it so.

### Legislating

My wife, at the time, was Chief of Staff for the state representative who presided over the district containing the hospice center and apartment complex. I don't think I could have said "that shit should be fucking illegal" to a person more capable of making it so.

My wife quickly had [the legislation]() drafted. When you draft law at the Texas House, you invoke the [Lege Council](https://tlc.texas.gov/), who are basically a bunch of lawyers who know where the law pertaining to certain matters is kept, and how to change it in such a way that would survive legal scrutiny. They're like programmers in a sense. Drafting law involves telling them in plain English the things you'd like the law to do, and on the other end of it, they give you a piece of paper that, if passed as law, would do that thing. My wife walked in and said "make it against the law to charge a corpse or its survivors back rent." It seems so simple, maybe even a bit dystopian in restrospect.

### Lobbying Pushback

I can only recall this story second hand, but I recall that my wife told me she actually didn't receive that much pushback from landlords or apartment companies. When the subject of that law came up with one such lobbyist, he remarked something to my wife along the lines of "yeah, that's the sort of bill we'd normally have to fight, but we can't do so without looking like monsters, so congrats on that one."

When the bill finally passed, it was done so with explicit acknowledgement of my aunt.

I hope she knows none of her life or death was in vain.
