## The Life and Death of Sylvia Joyce

My aunt Sylvia was my grandmother's first child. My grandmother married my grandfather against her guardians' wishes, and my grandfather was in the military, so she was entirely alone when Sylvia came. They had a deep bond founded in their mutual, but not equal, helplessness.

My aunt Sylvia would live a full life, ups, downs, and everything in between. She got married, divorced, had children, found love again, vacationed, sang, sewed, and more than anything, loved her family. In 2018, she was diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer.

She spent her last days in a hospice care facility in San Antonio. We visited her and she remarked how the hospice care facility didn't have good food, and all she wanted was some decent italian. It's San Antonio, I'll remind you, so they don't have any, but I looked up the best-rated local italian place and had them deliver a whole lasagna and slice of chocolate cake to her room. I think it might have been the only kindness I ever did to her.

At Aunt Sylvia's funeral, we were making casual conversation when her daughter mentioned the nightmare she had just had to deal with when closing out her mom's affairs. Aunt Sylvia had been renting an apartment on her meager Social Security when she found out she had cancer. When my cousin went to fetch family heirlooms from her mom's last dwelling, the landlord stood between her and the doorway and demanded a lease termination fee before letting my cousin in to fetch her family's heirlooms. As we were driving home, I told my wife "that shit should be fucking illegal." We would see to that.

### Legislating

My wife, at the time, was Chief of Staff for the state representative who presided over the district containing the hospice center and apartment complex. I don't think I could have said "that shit should be fucking illegal" to a person more capable of making it so.

My wife quickly had [the legislation](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=86R&Bill=HB69) drafted. When you draft law at the Texas House, you invoke the [Lege Council](https://tlc.texas.gov/), who are a team of lawyers who know where laws pertaining to given matters is kept, and how to change it in such a way that it would achieve some goal. Drafting law involves telling them in plain English the things you'd like the law to do, and on the other end of it, they give you a piece of paper that you can bring to the House floor to propose as law. My wife walked in and said "make it against the law to charge a survivor of a deceased tenant a lease termination fee." It seems so simple, maybe even a bit dystopian in restrospect.

### Lobbying Pushback

I can only recall this story second hand, but I recall that my wife told me she actually didn't receive that much pushback from landlords or apartment companies. When the subject of that law came up with one such lobbyist, he remarked something to my wife along the lines of "yeah, that's the sort of bill we'd normally fight, but if we do that, we look like monsters, so congrats on that one."

When the bill finally passed, it was done so with explicit acknowledgement of my aunt. I hope she knows neither her life or death were in vain.
